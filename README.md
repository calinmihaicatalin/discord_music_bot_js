The main purpose of this music bot was to provide a simple solution for playing music in Discord servers while being hosted locally. 
However, due to the evolving nature of Discord's API, the bot might not be up to date with the latest changes. Discord often updates their API weekly, which may impact the functionality of the bot.

This bot includes the following commands:

/info - displays all the available commands 
/play - finds the song on youtube and plays it in your current channel.
/queue - displays the current music queue
/skip - skips the current song being played
/skipto - skips the current song that is being played to the next one or the one specified
/clear - Stops the music and clears the queue
/quit - Disconnected the bot from the voice channel
/pause - pauses the current song being played or resumes if already paused
/resume - resumes playing the current song

Remember that you need to use your own token in the setup for the bot to be working properly.
